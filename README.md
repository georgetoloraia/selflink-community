# SelfLink Community

SelfLink Community is the public problem-solving hub of SelfLink.

It is the place where:
- Real problems are posted.
- People gather around them.
- Collaboration happens in the open.

Think of it as “open-source GitHub Issues + discussion + contribution tracking + rewards”, but designed for humans, not just developers.

## What A User Experiences

Anyone can browse. You do not need an account to look around. You can see:
- Problems
- Descriptions
- Discussions
- Artifacts (links, write-ups, proofs of work)
- How many people are working on each problem

## Problems Are The Center

Each problem is a real task or challenge. Not vague ideas — things that can be worked on.

Examples:
- “Improve onboarding UX for SelfLink mobile app”
- “Design contributor reward transparency page”
- “Optimize backend cost for 100k users”

## People Opt In, Not Get Assigned

You do not get “assigned” like Jira. You mark “I am working on this”. Others immediately see that you are involved. Collaboration forms naturally.

## Discussion Stays Attached To The Work

Comments are tied to problems. Artifacts are tied to problems. Nothing floats around disconnected.

## Artifacts Prove Contribution

An artifact can be:
- A GitHub PR
- A design mockup
- A doc
- A demo link

This is how work becomes visible and measurable.

## Agreements Protect Fairness

Before someone participates (likes, works, comments, submits artifacts), they accept a simple MIT-style agreement. This prevents future disputes:
- Who owns what
- How contributions are reused
- How rewards are distributed

## Recognition And Rewards Are First-Class

The dashboard shows:
- Total income flowing into SelfLink
- How much is reserved for contributors
- How many contributors are involved

This is not a forum. It is an economic collaboration layer.

## What It Is Not

- Not a social network feed
- Not a chat app
- Not a closed company backlog
- Not “just comments”

It is not about posting thoughts. It is about doing work together in public.

## Why It Exists

SelfLink Community exists because:
- Open source loses contributors’ work in the noise
- Traditional issue trackers do not reward people
- Discords lose history
- Companies extract value without transparency

This fixes that by making:
- Contribution visible
- Participation explicit
- Ownership clear
- Rewards traceable
